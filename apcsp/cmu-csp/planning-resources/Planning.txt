702 - 1/9 - A2 / 1/12 - B2 - CMU Academy (setup, introduction)
703 - 1/13 - A3 / 1/14 - B3 - Unit 1
704 - 1/15 - A4 / 1/16 - B4 - Unit 1
705 - 1/20 - A5 / 1/21 - B5 - Unit 1 Creative Task 1 DUE TOMORROW (Class time given today to work on it)


706 - 1/22 - A6 / 1/23 - B6 - 3rd 9 Weeks Day 6 - Unit 2: Function Basics
Introduce the concept of functions, parameters, and test cases, and practice converting repeated code into reusable functions. Students complete the Function Basics and Debugging lessons and begin independent practice.


707 - 1/26 - A7 / 1/27 - B7 - Unit 2: Multiple Parameters + Functions Practice
Extend functions to include multiple parameters and structured design, and guide students in building small multi-parameter drawing functions. Students complete CMU exercises on parameters with remaining work assigned as homework.


708 - 1/28 - A8 / 1/29 - B8 - Unit 2: Mouse Events (onMousePress / onMouseRelease)
Introduce event-driven programming with mouse events and practice creating programs that respond to user clicks. Students build simple interactive drawings using onMousePress and onMouseRelease.


709 - 1/30 - A9 / 2/2 - B9 - Unit 2: Variables + Shape Properties
Teach how to store shapes in variables and modify their properties dynamically, including position, size, and appearance. Students practice modifying objects in response to mouse input.


710 - 2/3 - A10 / 2/4 - B10 - Unit 2: Conditionals (if / if-else)
Introduce conditional logic and decision making using if and if-else statements. Students complete exercises that change program behavior based on conditions.


711 - 2/5 - A11 / 2/6 - B11 - Unit 2: Custom Properties, Shape Methods, if-elif-else
Combine conditionals with custom properties and shape methods to create more complex interactions. Students practice using toFront, toBack, hits, and conditional chains.


712 - 2/9 - A12 / 2/10 - B12 - Unit 2: Practice Exercises + Unit 2 Creative Task
Students review major Unit 2 concepts through guided practice and begin the Unit 2 Creative Task, applying functions, events, and conditionals in an open-ended project.


713 - 2/11 - A13 / 2/12 - B13 - Unit 3: Groups and Traversing Groups
Introduce Groups as collections of shapes and show how to traverse groups using loops. Students practice modifying multiple objects efficiently with for-loops.


714 - 2/13 - A14 / 2/16 - B14 - Unit 3: Lists and Traversing Lists
Teach lists as general-purpose collections and practice looping through lists and groups to control many elements at once. Students complete core list exercises.


715 - 2/17 - A15 / 2/18 - B15 - Unit 3: Traversing with len/range + List Methods
Expand list skills with indexing, range, len, and list methods such as append, insert, and pop. Students complete combined list and loop activities.


716 - 2/19 - A16 / 2/20 - B16 - Unit 3: Unit 3 Practice + Mini Creative Task
Students review and apply groups, lists, and loops through practice exercises and begin a short Unit 3 Creative Task to reinforce concepts.


717 - 2/23 - A17 / 2/24 - B17 - Unit 4: Complex Conditionals + Key Events
Introduce compound and nested conditionals along with keyboard events to allow richer user interaction. Students practice onKeyPress and onKeyHold.


718 - 2/25 - A18 / 2/26 - B18 - Unit 4: onStep Events + Strings
Teach onStep for animations and introduce strings and basic string manipulation. Students build small programs using animation and text processing.


719 - 2/27 - A19 / 3/2 - B19 - Unit 4: Libraries + Random + Images (Wrap Up)
Finish with libraries, random numbers, and using images and media, then complete final Unit 4 exercises and review how all concepts connect for future CPT work.


720 - 3/3 - A20 / 3/4 - B20 - Introduce Create Performance Task
721 - 3/5 - A21 / 3/6 - B21 - Review/Plan Create Performance Task
