# AP Computer Science Principles  
## Programming Semester – Quarter 3 Overview

---

## Purpose of This Quarter

This document describes the third nine-weeks grading period for AP Computer Science Principles. During this quarter, students will complete the core programming portion of the course using the CMU CS Academy AP CSP Python curriculum.

The focus of this quarter is on learning how to design, write, and understand interactive computer programs that meet the College Board expectations for the AP CSP Create Performance Task.

---

## Quarter Description

Throughout this quarter, students will learn how to:

- Write and organize Python programs  
- Create interactive graphics  
- Use functions and parameters  
- Respond to user input  
- Apply conditionals and decision making  
- Work with lists, loops, and events  
- Build larger programs using structured design  

The quarter is designed to prepare students to successfully begin and complete the AP CSP Create Performance Task, which is submitted to the College Board later in the course.

# Course Structure and Parameters

- **Length:** One grading period (approximately 21 class meetings)  
- **Class Duration:** 90 minutes  
- **Curriculum Platform:** CMU CS Academy – AP CSP Python  
- **Units Covered:** CMU Units 2, 3, and 4  
- **Final Outcome:** Readiness for the AP Create Performance Task  

---

## Instructional Methodology

This quarter follows a blended learning model that combines:

- Direct instruction  
- Guided coding practice  
- Independent problem solving  
- Project-based creative tasks  

### Typical Class Structure

- **30–45 minutes: Teacher-Led Instruction**
  - New programming concepts  
  - Live coding demonstrations  
  - Explanation of syntax and logic  
  - Guided examples  

- **45–60 minutes: Independent Practice**
  - Working through CMU CS Academy lessons  
  - Completing exercises and projects  
  - Debugging with teacher support  

### Homework Expectations

Programming requires regular practice.

- Unfinished CMU lessons become homework  
- Students are expected to continue assignments outside of class  
- Typical expectation: **30–60 minutes between class meetings**

# Topics Covered This Quarter

This quarter focuses on three major units of the CMU AP CSP curriculum.

| Unit | Core Topics |
|-----|-------------|
| **Unit 2** | Functions, mouse events, variables, conditionals |
| **Unit 3** | Groups, lists, loops, traversing collections |
| **Unit 4** | Complex conditionals, keyboard events, animation, libraries |

By the end of this quarter, students will have learned all programming concepts required for the AP Create Performance Task.

---

# Quarter Narrative

The quarter progresses in three major phases:

### Phase 1 – Interactive Programming Foundations  
Students learn to write reusable functions, respond to mouse input, and make decisions using conditionals.

### Phase 2 – Managing Collections of Data  
Students learn to work with groups, lists, and loops to control many objects efficiently.

### Phase 3 – Advanced Interactivity  
Students add keyboard controls, animation, strings, and libraries to build more sophisticated programs.

Each phase includes guided instruction, practice exercises, and creative tasks that allow students to apply what they have learned.

---

# Learning Goals

By the end of this quarter, students will be able to:

- Design and write custom functions  
- Create programs that react to user input  
- Use conditional logic to control program behavior  
- Store and manipulate collections of data  
- Use loops to process groups and lists  
- Build structured, multi-feature programs  
- Explain how their code works using correct AP terminology  

These skills directly prepare students for success on the AP CSP Create Performance Task.

---

# Major Assessments

During this quarter, students will complete several key graded tasks:

- Unit 2 Creative Task  
- Unit 3 Creative Task  
- Unit 4 programming assignments  
- Regular mastery checks  
- CMU exercise completion grades  

These assessments measure both programming skill and conceptual understanding.

---

# Grading Approach for This Quarter

Student grades reflect two main areas:

### Mastery and Understanding
- Programming projects  
- Concept checks  
- Creative tasks  
- Demonstrations of coding skills  

### Engagement and Progress
- Completion of CMU lessons  
- Productive use of class time  
- Consistent effort and practice  

Programming is a skill learned through doing, so regular completion of exercises is essential.

---

# End of Quarter Outcome

The final two class meetings of the quarter will focus on:

- Introduction to the AP Create Performance Task  
- Planning and brainstorming project ideas  
- Understanding College Board requirements  

Students will leave this quarter ready to begin their official AP project with confidence.

---

# Classroom Expectations

Students are expected to:

- Participate actively in lessons  
- Work consistently on CMU assignments  
- Ask questions when confused  
- Practice problem-solving and debugging  
- Maintain academic integrity  

Success in this course depends on persistence, curiosity, and regular practice.

---

# Technology Requirements

Students will need:

- Reliable access to a computer  
- Internet access to CMU CS Academy  
- Ability to complete online coding work outside of class  

---

## Preparing for the AP Exam

This quarter builds the exact programming foundation needed for:

- The AP CSP Create Performance Task  
- Understanding AP programming concepts  
- Future computer science courses  
- Real-world problem solving  

Students who engage fully with the material will be well prepared for the major AP requirements that follow.

---

### Summary

This quarter represents the core programming heart of AP Computer Science Principles. Through structured lessons, guided practice, and creative projects, students develop the skills needed to think computationally and to design meaningful software solutions.
