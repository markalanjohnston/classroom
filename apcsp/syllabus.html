          <h2><i class="bi bi-clipboard-check"></i> Classroom Rules and Expectations</h2>
          <p class="text-muted mb-3">The following rules and expectations apply to all students in this class. Failure to follow these rules may result in disciplinary action.</p>

          <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
            <li><strong><i class="bi bi-phone-slash text-danger"></i> Absolutely NO Cell Phone Use</strong> – For the sake of clarity, no student shall be permitted to access their cell phone in any way within my classroom at any time. If caught accessing a cell phone, the phone will be confiscated, turned off, and turned into the business office. <em>(This is state law.)</em></li>

            <li><strong><i class="bi bi-cup-straw text-warning"></i> No Food</strong> – Primarily because this is a computer lab.</li>

            <li><strong><i class="bi bi-droplet text-info"></i> Liquids Must Be in a Sealable Container</strong> – If you can't hold it upside down without it leaking, it's not sealed! Non-sealable containers can be tipped over and cause damage to equipment. The computer lab is also on a raised floor and there is electrical routed underneath the computer stations.</li>

            <li><strong><i class="bi bi-alarm text-danger"></i> BE ON TIME</strong> – For CTE Classes with TEKS related to punctuality, <strong>tardies may impact your grade.</strong> BE ON TIME!</li>

            <li><strong><i class="bi bi-heart text-primary"></i> Be Respectful</strong> – If you have any issue with a student or teacher, bring it up to the teacher at an appropriate time, in private.</li>

            <li><strong><i class="bi bi-envelope-at text-success"></i> Communicate Important Matters via Email</strong> – This keeps all parties accountable for the communication. Verbal communications can be misunderstood or forgotten and should not be relied upon for critical matters (ex: issues related to grades or time-sensitive matters like reassessments).</li>

            <li><strong><i class="bi bi-exclamation-circle text-warning"></i> Student Accountability</strong> – Students will be held accountable for all policies, deadlines, and other information on this site and any LMS used for the class (ex. Schoology, CMU Academy, Code.org, etc.).</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="info-card">
          <h2><i class="bi bi-clipboard-check"></i> Grading, Late Work, and Reassessment Policy</h2>

          <h3>Guiding Principles</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Grades are intended to reflect mastery of the TEKS, not effort alone or strategic behavior.</li>
            <li>Reassessments exist to support learning, not to replace responsibility or deadlines.</li>
            <li>Any opportunity provided by this policy is available equitably to all students.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-muted"><em>Where this policy differs from district policy, district policy supersedes. This policy may be more lenient, but not more strict.</em></p>

          <h3>Assignment Submission & Late Work</h3>
          <h4>On-Time Work</h4>
          <p>Assignments are expected to be submitted by the posted due date.</p>

          <h4>Late Work (without a reasonable or excused cause)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Work submitted up to 1 calendar day late will have 30 points deducted prior to grading.</li>
            <li>Work submitted more than 1 calendar day late will not be accepted and will be recorded as <strong>NHI (Not Handed In)</strong> and calculated as 0%.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>NHI Definition</h4>
          <p><strong>NHI (Not Handed In)</strong> indicates that the student was present, had access to the assignment, and chose not to submit it within the allowed timeframe.</p>
          <p>NHI grades represent lack of evidence, not lack of understanding.</p>

          <h3>Absences</h3>
          <h4>Excused Absences</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Students are allowed one school day per day absent to complete missed work for full credit, per district policy.</li>
            <li>Once the original attempt is completed, excused-absence work remains eligible for reassessment.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Unexcused Absences</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Work missed due to unexcused absences is subject to late-work rules and may result in NHI.</li>
            <li>Assignments resulting in NHI due to unexcused absences are not eligible for reassessment.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Reassessments (Redo / Retake Policy)</h3>
          <h4>Purpose</h4>
          <p>Reassessments are designed to allow students to demonstrate improved mastery of the same TEKS, not to replace missing work, ignore deadlines, or bypass academic integrity.</p>

          <h4>Eligibility (Equity Rule)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>All students may request reassessment for eligible assignments or tests.</li>
            <li>This ensures that any benefit of reassessment is available equally and does not advantage one student over another.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Ineligible Situations</h4>
          <p>Reassessments are not offered when the failing grade resulted from:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Academic dishonesty</li>
            <li>NHI (Not Handed In) due to student choice</li>
            <li>Unexcused absences</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>Assignments missed due to excused absences remain eligible after the original attempt is completed.</em></p>

          <h4>Reassessment Structure (District-Compliant)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Students may complete up to two additional attempts beyond the original.</li>
            <li>Reassessment tasks may be substantially different in format, but will assess the same content and standards.</li>
            <li>The final grade recorded will be the average of all completed attempts, per district policy.</li>
            <li>No attempt is dropped or replaced.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Original: 70</li>
            <li>Reassessment: 90</li>
            <li>→ Final grade = 80</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Timeline (Strictly Enforced)</h4>
          <p>Students have <strong>five school days</strong> from the date a grade is posted to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Request a reassessment in writing</li>
            <li>Complete the reassessment</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After each reassessment attempt, students have five school days to complete the next attempt (if eligible and if time remains in the grading period).</p>
          <p>Reassessments close at the end of the grading period unless extenuating circumstances are approved through administration.</p>
          <p><strong>Failure to act within the timeline constitutes forfeiture of the reassessment opportunity.</strong></p>

          <h4>Reassessment Procedure</h4>
          <p>To initiate a reassessment, the student must:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Submit a written request (email or form)</li>
            <li>Schedule a reassessment time within the allowed window</li>
            <li>Complete any assigned remediation or review activities (strongly encouraged)</li>
            <li>Complete the reassessment under teacher-determined conditions</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Academic Integrity</h4>
          <p>Reassessments are not permitted for assignments or tests involving cheating, plagiarism, or unauthorized collaboration. This determination is final.</p>

          <h3>Final Notes on Fairness</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>This policy does not reward intentional underperformance, as all attempts are averaged.</li>
            <li>Students who consistently submit work on time are not disadvantaged.</li>
            <li>Students who delay, miss deadlines, or fail to submit work do not gain an advantage through reassessment.</li>
            <li>Equal opportunity does not mean unlimited opportunity.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Administrative Clause</h3>
          <p>All grading decisions are made in accordance with district policy, campus guidelines, and professional judgment. In cases of conflict, district policy prevails.</p>

          <div class="warning-card mt-3" style="background: #fff3cd; border-color: #ffc107;">
            <p class="mb-0"><strong><i class="bi bi-exclamation-circle"></i> Policy Updates:</strong> I reserve the right to update this grading policy at any time. If updates are made, an email or other notice will be provided with fair advance notice before the changes take effect.</p>
