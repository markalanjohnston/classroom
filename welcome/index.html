        <p><strong>Dear Parents, Guardians, and Students,</strong></p>
        <p>Thank you for being part of this learning journey. I'm excited to partner with you this year as we embark on a journey of discovery, creativity, and real-world problem-solving. Your involvement and support make all the difference in the success of this program!</p>
        <p>This page is designed to give everyone a clear understanding of how my courses are structured online. Here, you'll find insights into my teaching philosophy, how to navigate the classroom website, and tips for staying informed about progress and assignments. My goal is to create a transparent and supportive learning environment where students, parents, and guardians all feel empowered and connected.</p>

        <h3><i class="bi bi-person-badge"></i> About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I'm Mr. Johnston, and I have the privilege of teaching P-TECH Computer Science at Chapin High School. With years of experience in both industry and education, I've developed a teaching philosophy centered on hands-on learning, clear expectations, and real-world applications. I believe every student has the potential to think like a software engineer, and my role is to nurture that potential through structured guidance and encouragement.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my classroom, students will experience a carefully crafted curriculum that balances challenge with support. They'll practice design thinking, build and iterate, document their process, and learn to communicate their ideas professionally—skills that will serve them well in any future career path. I maintain consistent routines and clear expectations, which helps students feel secure and confident as they tackle new challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rest assured that all students are in a supportive environment where mistakes are viewed as learning opportunities, creativity is celebrated, and every achievement—big or small—is recognized. I maintain high standards while providing the scaffolding students need to reach them successfully.

        <p class="mb-3">
          I've designed my classroom website to be a central hub for understanding what students are learning and how they're progressing. Everything is organized intuitively, making it easy to stay connected with the educational journey. The website is regularly updated with important course information and announcements, ensuring everyone stays informed about classroom activities.

        <h3><i class="bi bi-laptop"></i> Understanding Schoology: Your Window into Daily Learning</h3>
        
        <p>
          While my public website provides the big picture, Schoology is where the day-to-day magic happens. This is our secure learning management system where students access assignments, submit work, and receive personalized feedback. I've structured everything in Schoology with clarity and consistency in mind—you'll find organized folders for Weekly Plans, clearly labeled assignment sections, and detailed rubrics for every project.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe in complete transparency, which is why I encourage families to review Schoology regularly together. Every assignment comes with step-by-step instructions, clear expectations, and rubrics that eliminate guesswork. This structure helps students develop independence while ensuring everyone always knows what success looks like.
