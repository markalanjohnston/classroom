          <h2><i class="bi bi-book"></i> Course Overview</h2>
          <p><strong>What is Engineering Design Process?</strong></p>
          <p>Engineering Design Process (EDP) is a second-year engineering course that builds upon the foundational knowledge gained in Principles of Applied Engineering (PAE). Students deepen their understanding of the complete engineering design cycle through advanced robotics applications and complex STEM challenges. This course develops sophisticated engineering thinking skills, professional standards of conduct and ethics, and mastery of the iterative engineering problem-solving process.</p>
          <p>Building on PAE foundations, students tackle more complex design challenges requiring advanced problem identification, research synthesis, creative ideation, sophisticated prototyping, rigorous testing protocols, and professional communication. Advanced documentation through engineering notebooks, technical drawing and CAD modeling, and leadership in collaborative engineering teams are emphasized.</p>
          <p>The course advances occupational safety knowledge, develops project management leadership skills, and deepens understanding of engineers' ethical responsibilities while preparing students for high school engineering pathways and potential STEM careers.</p>
