## Purpose of This Semester

This document describes the **programming-focused semester** of the Fundamentals of Computer Science course. This semester uses the **CMU CS Academy CS1: Introduction to Programming** curriculum to address the programming and computational thinking components of the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) for computer science.

The other semester of Fundamentals of Computer Science addresses additional TEKS topics such as digital citizenship, technology operations, hardware concepts, binary representation, and web development.  
This semester is dedicated specifically to **learning to program.**

---

## Semester Description

During this semester, students will learn the fundamentals of computer programming through interactive, graphics-based projects. Instruction emphasizes:

- Logical problem solving  
- Algorithmic thinking  
- Debugging strategies  
- Writing and organizing code  
- Creating interactive programs  

No prior programming experience is required.

The semester is designed to prepare students for more advanced computer science courses such as AP Computer Science Principles, AP Computer Science A, or additional programming electives.

## Semester Narrative

The semester is intentionally divided into two distinct phases:

### First Half – “Learn the Core Tools of Programming”

Students develop essential skills:

- Variables and functions  
- Conditionals and decision making  
- Mouse and keyboard interaction  
- Building basic interactive programs  

### Second Half – “Use Those Tools to Build Bigger Things”

Students apply earlier skills to:

- Animation and motion  
- Loops and repetition  
- Randomization  
- Lists and simple games  
- Larger, more complex programs  

This structure ensures that students first master the basics before moving into more advanced programming concepts.

---

# Instructional Methodology

This semester uses a blended learning model that combines direct instruction with guided independent practice.

### Typical Class Structure

- **35–45 minutes: Teacher-Led Instruction**
  - Concept introduction  
  - Live coding demonstrations  
  - Explanation of new programming ideas  
  - Modeling problem-solving strategies  

- **45–55 minutes: Student Work Time**
  - Working through CMU CS Academy lessons and exercises  
  - Applying new skills  
  - Debugging with teacher support  

### Homework Expectations

Learning to program requires regular practice.

- Unfinished CMU lessons and exercises become homework  
- Students are expected to complete assigned coding work outside of class  
- Typical homework expectation: **30–60 minutes between class meetings**

This approach mirrors how real-world programming is learned and prepares students for future computer science coursework.

# Grading Plan for This Semester

---

## Grading Period Structure

Each grading period (20 classes) follows the same format:

| Category | Number of Grades | Weight Each | Total Weight |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Mastery / Understanding | 8 | 10% | **80%** |
| Engagement | 4 | 5% | **20%** |
| **Total** | 12 grades |  | **100%** |

---

### Mastery / Understanding Grades (80%)

These grades measure actual programming knowledge and skills. Examples include:

- Programming quizzes  
- Application labs  
- Mini-projects  
- Unit assessments  
- Cumulative programming tasks  

These grades reflect how well a student understands and can apply what has been learned.

---

### Engagement Grades (20%)

Engagement grades reward consistent effort and responsibility, including:

- Completion of assigned CMU CS Academy exercises  
- Productive use of class work time  
- Meeting homework expectations  
- Regular progress through online lessons  

Programming skill grows through practice; these grades encourage strong learning habits.

---

## Semester Grade Calculation

| Component | Percent of Semester |
|---------|--------------------|
| Grading Period 1 | **45%** |
| Grading Period 2 | **45%** |
| Semester Test – Unit 12 Final Project | **10%** |
| **Total** | **100%** |

The **Unit 12 Final Project** serves as the semester test grade and is completed during the final two class meetings.

---
