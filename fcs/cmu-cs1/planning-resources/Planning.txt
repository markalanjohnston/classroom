	Unit 2-1 Project Launch + Foundations: Introduce the Internet-connected clock project, explain learning goals and safety, form teams, create group contracts, review electronics basics (voltage, current, polarity), and complete a short written plan outlining what “success” looks like.
	310
	Unit 2-2 Hardware Deep Dive: Hands-on exploration of all components (microcontroller, LED matrix, power, resistors, wiring), reading schematics, labeling parts, practicing breadboard connections, and completing a guided “component identification lab.”
	311
	Unit 2-3 Programming Environment Bootcamp: Install and configure the IDE, learn to compile and upload code, practice editing simple variables in a starter sketch, and complete a mini-assignment modifying display text or colors.
	312
	Unit 2-4 Soldering Training + Certification: Direct instruction on soldering safety and technique, guided practice on test boards, individual skill checks, and beginning soldering of real project components.
	313
	Unit 2-5 Core Hardware Assembly: Complete soldering and physical assembly of the clock hardware, wire the LED matrix to the microcontroller, test power circuits, and troubleshoot basic connection issues as a team.
	314
	Unit 2-6 Code Walkthrough + Display Logic: Step-by-step lesson through the provided clock program, explanation of how time is calculated and displayed, small coding exercises, and teams documenting how the software interacts with the hardware.
	315
	FLEX DAY: Dedicated time for teams to catch up, re-solder, rewire, fix broken code, get one-on-one help, or redo earlier steps as needed.
	316
	Unit 2-7 Networking Concepts + Wi-Fi Setup: Mini-lessons on IP addresses and networks, configuring the device to join Wi-Fi, testing connectivity, and learning how the clock retrieves time from the internet.
	317
	Unit 2-8 Remote Control Interface: Guided lesson on simple web interfaces or control commands, teams implementing basic remote features (change colors, set brightness, display messages), and testing functionality from a phone or laptop.
	318
	Unit 2-9 Troubleshooting & Reliability Testing: Systematic debugging day where teams diagnose hardware and software issues, stress-test their builds, learn to use multimeters, and document fixes in a technical log.
	319
	Unit 2-10 Customization & Documentation: Teams add one approved custom feature, finalize wiring and enclosure, write a build guide explaining their process, and prepare presentation materials.
	320
	Unit 2-11 Presentation, Demo, and Reflection: Formal team demonstrations of the working clocks, peer feedback, written technical reflections, and discussion connecting the project to real-world IT and engineering practices.
	321
	Unit 2-12 FLEX DAY
