        <div class="info-card">
          <h2><i class="bi bi-clipboard-check"></i> Grading, Late Work, and Reassessment Policy</h2>

          <h3>Guiding Principles</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Grades are intended to reflect mastery of the TEKS, not effort alone or strategic behavior.</li>
            <li>Reassessments exist to support learning, not to replace responsibility or deadlines.</li>
            <li>Any opportunity provided by this policy is available equitably to all students.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-muted"><em>Where this policy differs from district policy, district policy supersedes. This policy may be more lenient, but not more strict.</em></p>

          <h3>Assignment Submission & Late Work</h3>
          <h4>On-Time Work</h4>
          <p>Assignments are expected to be submitted by the posted due date.</p>

          <h4>Late Work (without a reasonable or excused cause)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Work submitted up to 1 calendar day late will have 30 points deducted prior to grading.</li>
            <li>Work submitted more than 1 calendar day late will not be accepted and will be recorded as <strong>NHI (Not Handed In)</strong> and calculated as 0%.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>NHI Definition</h4>
          <p><strong>NHI (Not Handed In)</strong> indicates that the student was present, had access to the assignment, and chose not to submit it within the allowed timeframe.</p>
          <p>NHI grades represent lack of evidence, not lack of understanding.</p>

          <h3>Absences</h3>
          <h4>Excused Absences</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Students are allowed one school day per day absent to complete missed work for full credit, per district policy.</li>
            <li>Once the original attempt is completed, excused-absence work remains eligible for reassessment.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Unexcused Absences</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Work missed due to unexcused absences is subject to late-work rules and may result in NHI.</li>
            <li>Assignments resulting in NHI due to unexcused absences are not eligible for reassessment.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Reassessments (Redo / Retake Policy)</h3>
          <h4>Purpose</h4>
          <p>Reassessments are designed to allow students to demonstrate improved mastery of the same TEKS, not to replace missing work, ignore deadlines, or bypass academic integrity.</p>

          <h4>Eligibility (Equity Rule)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>All students may request reassessment for eligible assignments or tests.</li>
            <li>This ensures that any benefit of reassessment is available equally and does not advantage one student over another.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Ineligible Situations</h4>
          <p>Reassessments are not offered when the failing grade resulted from:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Academic dishonesty</li>
            <li>NHI (Not Handed In) due to student choice</li>
            <li>Unexcused absences</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>Assignments missed due to excused absences remain eligible after the original attempt is completed.</em></p>

          <h4>Reassessment Structure (District-Compliant)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Students may complete up to two additional attempts beyond the original.</li>
            <li>Reassessment tasks may be substantially different in format, but will assess the same content and standards.</li>
            <li>The final grade recorded will be the average of all completed attempts, per district policy.</li>
            <li>No attempt is dropped or replaced.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Original: 70</li>
            <li>Reassessment: 90</li>
            <li>→ Final grade = 80</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Timeline (Strictly Enforced)</h4>
          <p>Students have <strong>five school days</strong> from the date a grade is posted to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Request a reassessment in writing</li>
            <li>Complete the reassessment</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After each reassessment attempt, students have five school days to complete the next attempt (if eligible and if time remains in the grading period).</p>
          <p>Reassessments close at the end of the grading period unless extenuating circumstances are approved through administration.</p>
          <p><strong>Failure to act within the timeline constitutes forfeiture of the reassessment opportunity.</strong></p>

          <h4>Reassessment Procedure</h4>
          <p>To initiate a reassessment, the student must:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Submit a written request (email or form)</li>
            <li>Schedule a reassessment time within the allowed window</li>
            <li>Complete any assigned remediation or review activities (strongly encouraged)</li>
            <li>Complete the reassessment under teacher-determined conditions</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Academic Integrity</h4>
          <p>Reassessments are not permitted for assignments or tests involving cheating, plagiarism, or unauthorized collaboration. This determination is final.</p>

          <h3>Final Notes on Fairness</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>This policy does not reward intentional underperformance, as all attempts are averaged.</li>
            <li>Students who consistently submit work on time are not disadvantaged.</li>
            <li>Students who delay, miss deadlines, or fail to submit work do not gain an advantage through reassessment.</li>
            <li>Equal opportunity does not mean unlimited opportunity.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Administrative Clause</h3>
          <p>All grading decisions are made in accordance with district policy, campus guidelines, and professional judgment. In cases of conflict, district policy prevails.</p>
