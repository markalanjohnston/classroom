      <h4 class="alert-heading">Welcome to Our Engineering Community!</h4>
      <p class="mb-2"><strong>Dear Parents and Guardians,</strong></p>
      <p>Thank you for entrusting me with your student's engineering education. I apologize for not sending this welcome message sooner—the first week was dedicated to ensuring every student felt comfortable and ready to succeed in our hands-on learning environment. Your patience while we established our classroom routines and procedures is greatly appreciated.</p>
      <p class="mb-0">I'm excited to partner with you this year as we guide your student through an engaging journey of discovery, creativity, and real-world problem-solving. Your involvement and support make all the difference in their success!</p>

        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="mb-3">
            I'm Mr. Johnston, and I have the privilege of teaching Principles of Applied Engineering and W.I.N. Robotics at Hornedo. With years of experience in both industry and education, I've developed a teaching philosophy centered on hands-on learning, clear expectations, and real-world engineering applications. I believe every student has the potential to think like an engineer, and my role is to nurture that potential through structured guidance and encouragement.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            In my classroom, your student will experience a carefully crafted curriculum that balances challenge with support. They'll practice design thinking, build and iterate on prototypes, document their engineering process, and learn to communicate their ideas professionally—skills that will serve them well in any future career path. I maintain consistent routines and clear expectations, which helps students feel secure and confident as they tackle new challenges.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Rest assured that your student is in a supportive environment where mistakes are viewed as learning opportunities, creativity is celebrated, and every achievement—big or small—is recognized. I maintain high standards while providing the scaffolding students need to reach them successfully.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            You can learn more about my background, teaching philosophy, and classroom expectations here:

            I've designed my classroom website to be your central hub for understanding what your student is learning and how they're progressing. Everything is organized intuitively, making it easy for you to stay connected with their educational journey. The website is regularly updated with current assignments, project showcases, and important announcements, ensuring you're always informed about classroom activities.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            To get started, simply visit my classroom website and select the course card that matches your student's class. I've included detailed screenshots below to guide you through the navigation process. You'll notice that items are clearly marked: those with a <span class="badge badge-route">a</span> badge indicate the Principles of Applied Engineering path, while those with a <span class="badge badge-route">b</span> badge show the W.I.N. Robotics path. This color-coding system makes it simple to find exactly what you need.

          <h3 class="h5">Understanding Schoology: Your Window into Daily Learning</h3>
          <p class="mb-3">
            While my public website provides the big picture, Schoology is where the day-to-day magic happens. This is our secure learning management system where students access assignments, submit work, and receive personalized feedback. I've structured everything in Schoology with clarity and consistency in mind—you'll find organized folders for Weekly Plans, clearly labeled assignment sections, and detailed rubrics for every project.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            I believe in complete transparency with families, which is why I encourage you to ask your student to show you their Schoology account regularly. When you look together, you'll see that every assignment comes with step-by-step instructions, clear expectations, and rubrics that eliminate guesswork. This structure helps students develop independence while ensuring they always know what success looks like. The consistent organization also means your student can easily find resources when they need them, reducing stress and promoting confidence.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Below are screenshots from the student view so you know exactly what your child sees when they log in. Notice how everything is thoughtfully organized—this isn't by accident. This careful structure helps students develop executive functioning skills that will benefit them throughout their academic career and beyond.
